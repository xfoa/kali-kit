This is a beta release of 1.2.  I *know* it still has a few problems
and I'm working on it.  The mosst noticable problem is that the kali /s
list (or /kali in kchat) doesn't workk 100% of the time.  This is the 
side affect of some major changes in Kali and I haven't worked out all
the details yet.

Not all of the servers are running 1.2 yet.  You can use Kali Central
and Kali World.

tracker.texas.net      204.96.20.10    Kali Central  SunOS   KC0001
kali.net               206.197.190.20  Kali World    Linux   KC0003


If you are upgrading from a previous version of Kali, please read the
revision.lst file and have a look at the new sample kali.cfg and
kchat.cfg files.


Please report any problems to jay@calc.vet.uga.edu.  Include the
following:

1. What version of Kali are you using?
2. Connection type: {PPP, SLIP, SLiRP, ethernet}
3. Packet driver: {etherppp, slipper, cslipper, wd8003e, 3c509, etc.}
4. If using modem, what brand/model of modem and speed?
5. If using modem, what init string are you using?
6. Command line used to start packet driver.
7. Script used when connecting to host (or at least outline the prompts)
8. A copy of wattcp.cfg.
9. A copy of kali.cfg.
10. A description of the problem and what steps you have taken to try to
    resolve the problem.  I want to know at what point in the instructions
    in kali.doc you can't get past.  If you send me email stating that you
    cannot connect to Kali Central and don't tell me that you can ping it
    successfully, I will just send you a copy of this message.  Please try
    to read the instructions first.

Thanks,
Jay
