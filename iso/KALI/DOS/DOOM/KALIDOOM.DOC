Use this driver instead of the default ipxsetup.exe driver to
improve the performance of Doom over Kali. 

OPTION #1
---------  

Copy kalidoom.exe to your idsoftware game directory and type 
"kalidoom" to start a 2 player cooperative game on the default
port.  

The following options can be typed on the command line to change
the game.  All players must use the same options!!!  There are 
more options.  See the readme file for your specific game.

-nodes X	Replace X with the number of players (1 to 4)
-port X		Replace X with any number from 1 to 65535
-deathmatch	Start in deathmatch mode instead of cooperative
-skill X	X = the skill level in the game
-nomonsters	Remove the monsters from the game.  Humans only.

Adjusting speed:

-t X		Replace X with a number from 1 to 5.  Higher numbers
		are faster.  The default is 2.
-e X		Replace X with a number from 0 to 5.  This determines
		how much backup data is sent in each packet.  The 
		default is 1.  This will add one extra frame of info
		to each packet.  If one packet is lost the next packet
		will automatically contain the missing data.  Higher
		numbers include more info, but make the packets bigger.
		If Doom tends to play quickly for awhile and then make
		a long pause and then continue you should increase this
		number.  Kali95 users on 28.8 will find "-e 5" useful.

OPTION #2
---------

Rename the existing ipxsetup.exe driver to doomipx.exe.  Then copy the
kalidoom.exe file to the game directory and rename it as ipxsetup.exe.
Then use the setup.exe or dm.exe utilities like you normally would to
select game options.  See the readme file from the game for details.
You cannot set the -t or -e options using kalidoom this way yet.

Good Luck!
