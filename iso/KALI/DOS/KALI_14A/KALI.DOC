GENERAL

                          Introduction

What  is Kali? Kali is the largest Internet gaming system in  the
world  with  over 120,000 users and 500 servers in 60  countries.
Kali  supports more games than any other internet gaming  system,
including  Descent, Descent 2, Warcraft, Warcraft  2,  Command  &
Conquer,  NetMech (DOS and Win95), EF2000, Top Gun,  Duke  Nukem,
Quake,  Doom, Doom II, Heretic, Hexen, Apache, Rise of the Triad,
Terminal Velocity, VR Pool, Super Karts, Mortal Combat 3, Big Red
Racing,  and  several other games. The Kali system runs  in  DOS,
Windows 95, OS/2, and Macintosh. The Kali Servers run on UNIX and
Windows 95/NT machines and can each handle up to 400 users.

How  does Kali work? It's actually quite simple. Kali fools  your
games  into  thinking your computer is connected to a very  large
local  IPX network. Almost any game that supports the IPX network
protocol will work with Kali. Of course there are exceptions; not
all  games  can handle the packet loss and slow speeds  that  are
common on the Internet. Some games like Warcraft 2 and Duke Nukem
have  special options built into the games to improve  the  speed
over the Internet.

How  well  does  Kali work? It definitely works better  for  some
people  than  others.  Using a fast  modem  (28.8  or  ISDN)  and
connecting  to  a  fast Internet provider  will  make  Kali  work
better.  Not all modems work equally. Not all Internet  providers
work the same. You might have to shop around to find good quality
and  low  prices.  We  don't  currently  recommend  any  specific
Internet   providers  (also  called  ISPs  -   Internet   Service
Providers),  but  you can use several of the  national  providers
like Earthlink, Concentric, MSN, and Netcom (Netcruiser), or find
a local ISP that offers PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) connections
and has a fast Internet connection (ask for full T1 or better).

How  much does Kali cost? Only $20 (US). This is a one-time  fee.
Kali  charges  no hourly or monthly fees. Once you  register  you
never have to pay to access the public servers and other players.
The  only cost you will have is the cost of your Internet access.
After all, why pay more?

What?  You don't want to read all this and you think you're smart
enough to just jump in there and start using it now? Well, if you
insist, but at least follow these steps:

PPP (dial-up users):

1.   Put  KALIDOS.EXE in its own directory. Extract the files  by
     typing  KALIDOS.  This will extract Kali and  several  other
     files.

2.   Get a copy of PPPSHARE.EXE from the Klos ftp site:

     ftp://ftp.klos.com/pub/demo/pppshare.exe

     Place PPPSHARE.EXE in the Kali directory (the same directory
     as kalidos.exe) and extract it's files by typing PPPSHARE.

3.   Edit  kali.cfg to configure your nickname, email,  realname,
     and location.

4.   Edit  wattcp.cfg  to  set "ppp = 1" (remove  the  space  and
     semicolon from the beginning of the line).

5.   Edit  net.cfg  to enter the correct com port, phone  number,
     and modem init string.

6.   Type LOAD at the DOS prompt.

7.   Select "Connect" and then "Current" from the menu.

8.   After the modem connects enter your user name and password.

9.   Press  alt-s  to  start  the PPP driver  then  exit  PPPMENU
     without hanging up or disconnecting.

10.  Type  "KALI  /L" to get a list of servers. Then enter  "KALI
     <server ip#>" to connect to a server. Then run KCHAT.

11.  If  it  didn't work, read the rest of this document  and  be
     more patient next time. :)

SLIP and Ethernet:

1. Forget it! Read the manual!



                   Chapter I: Getting Prepared

Hardware:

If your site is directly connected to the Internet (NOT connected
through a modem!), you'll need a network interface card (NIC) for
your  machine (this is usually an Ethernet card). We will  assume
that your PC is already equipped with a suitable NIC, although it
may  currently be in use for some other non-TCP/IP function (such
as a node on a Novell network).

     NOTE:  You do NOT *need* an Ethernet card to use  Kali.
     Kali only requires an Ethernet card if you are directly
     connected  (like at work or school), but  it  can  also
     work with a modem for most games.

If you are not directly connected, you'll need a high speed modem
(the  faster  the  better) as well as  an  account  with  an  ISP
(Internet   Service   Provider)  which   has   suitable   dial-up
facilities. A 28.8 modem is highly recommended. Some  games  will
work with a 14.4 modem, but usually with only 2 or 3 players in a
game.  Be  sure  the  ISP  offers SLIP or  PPP  support  (PPP  is
recommended).

NOTE: Users with "shell accounts" or who use SLIP emulators  such
as  TIA and SLiRP can also use Kali. See the section "Using  Kali
with a shell account."

If  you're currently using SLIP or PPP, but your drivers  operate
from  under Microsoft Windows (such as Trumpet Winsock), you MUST
use  a DOS dialer to connect; your Windows-based drivers will NOT
work  for  Kali.  DOS Kali will NOT work in a  DOS  window  under
Windows  95. If you want to use Windows 95, get a copy of  Kali95
instead (see introduction). Kali will not work in Windows 3.1  or
3.11 at all.

Software:

In  addition to the hardware requirements, some software is  also
required to complete your setup. Before you can play, you'll need
to pick up the following:

Kali for DOS. Get KALIDOS.EXE from any of these sites:

ftp://ftp.kali.net/pub/kali/kalidos.exe
ftp://ftp.internexus.net/pub/kali/kalidos.exe
ftp://ftp.epix.net/pub/kali/kalidos.exe

KALIDOS.EXE  comes  with the packet drivers for  most  SLIP,  and
Ethernet  connections,  but it does not contain  the  PPP  driver
anymore (sorry).  Get the Klos PPPSHARE driver from:

ftp://ftp.klos.com/pub/demo/pppshare.exe


         Chapter II: Making the Packet Driver Connection

Setting  up  your  computer to use a DOS  packet  driver  can  be
complicated  for  people who aren't network gurus.  This  section
will  attempt to show you all the steps needed to get the  packet
driver  installed and functioning properly. Be sure to  read  the
correct section for the packet driver you will be using.


Using Kali with Klos' PPPSHARE Driver
=====================================

This is the recommended setup for PPP users. Because of conflicts
with  some ISPs (including CompuServe) you may also need  to  try
the  Merit  PPP driver. Get ppp.zip from your favorite  Kali  ftp
site  for  more  information.  NOTE:  Only  get  this  driver  if
PPPSHARE doesn't work for you.

A.   Get the PPPSHARE packet driver for PPP users.

     Get PPPSHARE.EXE from the Klos ftp site:

     ftp://ftp.klos.com/pub/demo/pppshare.exe

     Put KALIDOS.EXE and PPPSHARE.EXE in a directory together.  I
     would recommend c:\kali. It is assumed that you know how  to
     create  a  directory in DOS. If not, you will have  to  seek
     help from friends or books.

B.   Extract the files.

     Go to the Kali directory and type KALIDOS. This will extract
     the  files  needed for this setup.  Do not run KALIDOS  ever
     again unless you want to overwrite the setup files and start
     over  again.  Then type PPPSHARE to extract the  PPP  packet
     driver and related files.

C.   Running PPP Menu to setup the dialer.

     1.   Go  to your Kali directory and type PPPMENU. Press  the
          Enter key over the entry labeled "Current".

     2.   You  will  now get a menu with the following 6  options
          (press Esc to return to the prior menu):

          Port           - specify the com port to use
          Modem               - settings for your modem
          Scripting      - used to automate connection
          LCP Parameters - advanced PPP settings
          IP Parameters  - specify Internet settings
          Authentication - used for automated password entry

     3.   The  following  paragraphs describe each  menu  option.
          Most users only have to set the Port and Modem options.
          Leave  the  rest alone unless you want to  try  for  an
          automatic  login.  We  suggest trying  a  manual  login
          first.

D.   Modify your profile.

     1.   Port Settings:

          I/O Port:  allows you to select com1/2/3/4 or  special.
               If  you  select "special" you will  be  given  the
               chance to set your modem's Base Port.

          Interrupt: this is usually selected automatically based
               on  the I/O port you selected above. For com1  and
               com3  use  interrupt  4. For  com2  and  com4  use
               interrupt 3.

          Baudrate:  if  you are using a 16550 uart  and  a  28.8
               modem  select  115200. Some people  have  reported
               problems running at this speed. Try 57600  if  you
               get  lockups. If you have a 16550 uart and a  14.4
               modem select 57600. If you don't have a 16550 uart
               you must select a speed of 38400 or slower.

          Flow Control: select Hardware.

          Open Type: select Active for most configurations.

          Listen: select Don't Answer.

          Connection   type:  select  Modem-Terminal.  The  other
               settings are used for automated logins.

          Frame Type: select Ethernet II


     2.   Modem Settings:

          Phone Number: put your local access number here.

          Modem Name: just a description of your modem.

          Command  Strings:  Use  the Initialization  Strings  to
               setup  your  modem to use data compression,  error
               correction, and RTS/CTS flow control.  Most  Hayes
               compatibles  need at&f2 and USR modems  use  at&f1
               (you  would  normally leave  the  first  two  init
               strings alone and put your special init string  in
               Init  String  3).  Check you modem's  manual.  The
               Dialing  Prefix  should be set  to  ATDT  in  most
               cases. Answer string isn't used but should be  set
               to ATA. The hangup string for most modems is ATH0.

          Timers/Counters: Set the number of Dial Retries to  10.
               Set  the Connection Time-out to 90. Pause time  to
               5. Inactivity time to 5

     3.   Scripting Menu:

          This  is  where you can setup an automatic  dialer.  We
          recommend manually connecting first before trying this.
          The  scripting is accomplished by having you provide  a
          set  of prompts and the appropriate responses to  each.
          You  do  not have to enter the prompts for dialing  and
          connecting   since   this  will  be   taken   care   of
          automatically  by pppshare. Your script  will  probably
          begin  with  a prompt (Expected String) something  like
          "username:".   The  response  would  be   your   actual
          username. If you put a "\r" at the end of the response,
          pppshare will type a carriage-return for you. You  *DO*
          want this in most cases. You will then probably need to
          enter  a  prompt for your password in a similar manner.
          Most  standard C string sequences can be used. E.g.  \n
          for  newline,  \0-7 octal number, \" double  quote,  \r
          carriage  return, etc. Be sure to select modem-autodial
          or  modem-demand dial under Connection type in the Port
          Settings Menu.


     4.   LCP Parameters: do not modify these unless you are told
          to do so or you know what you are doing.

          Maximum Receive Unit: set to 1500.

          Async-Control Map: set to FFFFFFFF.

          Magic Number: set to 00000000.

          Protocol  Compression and Address/Control  Compression:
               normal set on. Some people might have to turn this
               off if using an older PPP terminal server.

     5.   IP Parameters: you don't need to modify these.

          Enable/Disable IP: Set to Enable IP.

          Header  Compression: set to Disable for  pppshare.  The
               shareware   version   will  not   support   header
               compression. Since this won't affect  Kali,  don't
               worry about it.

          IP Address: Most people should leave this blank. If you
               have  a  dynamically assigned IP number  (your  IP
               number  changes each time you connect) you  always
               leave  this  blank. With a static  IP  number  you
               might need to enter the number here.

     6.   Authentication Menu: don't worry about this unless  you
          want to configure your connection for PAP support.

E.   Save your new profile and connect to your ISP

     1.   Pressing Esc on the configuration menu will prompt  you
          with  a  menu  for  saving your setup (if  you  changed
          anything).  Select  "Save and write net.cfg"  and  then
          exit  PPPMENU. If you get an error when trying to  save
          net.cfg  you  might  have entered  an  incorrect  value
          somewhere. You will either have to exit without  saving
          or find the bad entry.

     2.   Type  LOAD  from the Kali directory. This  will  run  a
          batch  file to load a couple of files before and  after
          running  PPPMENU.  You will then  get  a  new  menu  in
          PPPMENU  with several options not available before.  If
          your  PC  locks up or hangs when trying to run LOAD  or
          you  do  not get the new menu options, then the PPP.EXE
          file  that  should  have loaded from the  LOAD  command
          failed to load. This is normally caused by an incorrect
          modem port being specified. Run the FIND_COM utility to
          see  if  your modem is reported correctly. If not,  you
          may     have     to     re-configure    your     modem.

     3.   Press  Enter  to select the "Connect" option  and  then
          press Enter again to select "Current". You should  then
          get  a message that your modem is being initialized and
          then  a  message  that your modem is dialing.  If  this
          fails  (you  don't  hear  it dialing)  you  might  have
          specified the wrong com port or wrong init string.

     4.   If  everything  is working properly you  should  get  a
          login prompt from your Internet provider. Normally  you
          just have to enter your username and password. Netcom's
          Netcruiser users will have to put a pound sign ("#") in
          front of their username to get PPP access (if your user
          name  is "BillyBob", you would enter "#BillyBob").  MSN
          users  must  enter "MSN/" before their  password  like:
          MSN/BillyBob.  Concentric users would  add  @ppp  after
          their  username. You might have to ask your ISP how  to
          login manually. You will then either get a message that
          your  PPP session has started or you might just  see  a
          stream  of  strange characters on your screen.  If  you
          just  get  another prompt like "blah>"  you  must  type
          something  else.  On many servers you would  type  "ppp
          default" to start a PPP session.

          Do  not  continue  unless you get a message  indicating
          that PPP has started or you get the strange characters.
          If you don't get a login prompt at all contact your ISP
          to  find out if they even support manual login. If not,
          they might use PAP or CHAP.

          This  PPP driver can handle PAP by enabling PAP in  the
          Authentication  menu  and  adding  your  username   and
          password.  Also  be  sure  to  select  the  option  for
          AUTODIAL for the connection type.

          To use CHAP (used by AT&T) you will need the commercial
          PPP driver from Klos. Get:

          http://ftp.klos.com/pub/demo/pppdemo.zip


     5.   At  this  point you press "alt-s" (hold down the  "alt"
          key while pressing the "s" key). If your connection  is
          working  properly you should be returned  to  the  main
          menu in PPPMENU with a few new menu items.


F.   Check your PPP connection using PPPMENU

     1.   The  main  menu  looks different after connecting.  You
          should now see 7 options:

          Disconnect               - close PPP session
          Status              - select status screens
          Send Echo Request   - send one "echo" packet
          Performance Test    - perform throughput test
          Echo Test           - perform response test
          Hang-Up             - hang up modem
          Exit                - exit PPPMENU

     2.   Press  Status several times to rotate through  the  two
          status  screens.  On the first status  screen  the  two
          options  at  the right labeled "LCP Status"  and  "IPCP
          Status" should both say "Opened". If they don't, do not
          continue. Go back to the previous step to find out what
          went wrong.

     3.   While displaying the first status screen (the one  that
          shows all the connection statistics including number of
          packets  sent  and received) move the cursor  to  "Send
          Echo Request" and press Enter once. You should see  the
          bytes   sent  increase  and  then  the  bytes  received
          increase.

     4.   Run  "Performance Test" to see how fast your connection
          is. The idea is just to see that everything seems to be
          working  on your PPP connection. You should see packets
          being sent and received at about the same speed. If the
          connection speed was set to 57600 you might see  speeds
          around  5000-6000  bytes/second. If  the  numbers  jump
          around,  your modem initialization string may be  wrong
          or  your  ISP  wants  you to slow  down.  Try  a  lower
          connection speed (115200->57600->38400->19200).

     5.   Exit  PPPMENU  and  be  sure you don't  see  any  error
          messages.  You  should see IPSTUB load with  a  message
          that  IP  is  open and PPPSTATE should report  IPCP  is
          open. If you see a message stating "Cannot bind to  PPP
          driver" this just means that you must have already  run
          "load"  before  and didn't run "unload"  before  trying
          again.  The  message "IP Not Open" will  occur  if  you
          didn't connect properly.

G.   PPP is Connected!

     You  can  now run any Internet software which uses a  packet
     driver.  This includes the CUTCP software from Clarkson.  At
     this point you should have a PPP connection to your ISP.

     From  now  on  you should only have to type  LOAD  and  then
     select the options to "Connect" using the "Current" profile.
     You  will  then enter your username and password  and  press
     "alt-s" to start PPP. Then just exit PPPMENU.

     So  far you haven't done anything directly related to  Kali.
     The next section deals with testing your Internet connection
     itself.  This isn't the same as testing your PPP  connection
     which we did in this chapter using PPPMENU.

     Be  sure  to  skip the next few sections dealing with  other
     packet drivers. Move on to Chapter III now.


Using Kali with SLIP
====================
This  procedure  assumes  that you are using  the  cslipper  SLIP
driver  mentioned  earlier. If you are using a different  driver,
you'll need to change the commands which follow accordingly.

A.   Obtain  Internet access from a service provider  who  allows
     SLIP connections on their terminal server. A "shell account"
     (where  you  log in to a remote UNIX host and type  commands
     such  as  "telnet" and "ftp") will require a  SLIP  emulator
     called   SLiRP   (read  the  SLiRP  section   below   before
     continuing). How to obtain this type of service from such  a
     provider is beyond the scope of this document.

B.   Using  your favorite serial communications package, dial  in
     to  your  service  provider,  log  in,  and  issue  whatever
     commands  are  required to change their terminal  server  to
     SLIP mode. How this is done varies from service provider  to
     service  provider and is beyond the scope of this  document.
     Check with your service provider for more details.

C.   Once  you  have logged on and enabled SLIP mode,  exit  your
     telecommunications software WITHOUT HANGING UP THE  MODEM  -
     this is VERY IMPORTANT! Any telecommunications package worth
     the  floppy  on  which it comes will have  a  "save  without
     hangup"  command, or will prompt you when you  exit  to  ask
     whether it should hang up or not.

D.   Change  to the directory where you have installed  Kali  and
     unzip the SLIP driver by typing "PKUNZIP SLIPPR15.ZIP".   If
     you do not have PKUNZIP check the following Web page:

     http://www.pkware.com/

     Then run SLIPPER (or CSLIPPER). For example:

     CSLIPPER com1 vec=0x60 baud=57600 ether

     NOTE:  Previous versions of Kali did not require the "ether"
     option.  This is now needed for Kali.  This basically  tells
     Kali to treat the SLIP driver like an Ethernet driver.

     Com1  is  the serial port to which your modem is  connected,
     0x60  is the interrupt vector the packet driver should  use,
     and  57600  is the DTE baud rate (the baud rate between  the
     computer  and the modem, not necessarily the speed at  which
     the  modem has connected to the remote system). Be  sure  to
     set  the  speed in the communications program  to  the  same
     speed  you  use  on  the cslipper command line.  The  packet
     driver  will  display a signon message and load itself  into
     memory. Be sure to try both slipper and cslipper if you  run
     into problems.

     Your SLIP packet driver is now loaded and ready for testing.

Using Kali With a Shell Account
===============================
To  use  Kali with a shell account, you need a SLIP/PPP emulator.
The  only  SLIP  emulator that current supports  port-redirection
(something  very  important to Kali) is a program  called  SLiRP.
Many  Internet  providers, including Netcom,  use  TIA  for  SLIP
access. TIA 2.0 doesn't work with Kali. Use SLiRP instead.

A.   You  *must*  use  SLiRP version 0.9k  or  newer.  The  older
     versions  just won't work with Kali (problems with  the  UDP
     redirection  code).  To  get SLiRP, login  into  your  shell
     account  and from there download the SLiRP source code  from
     your  favorite Kali site, or the latest can always be  found
     at:

     ftp://blitzen.canberra.edu.au/pub/slirp/

B.   The instructions for installing SLiRP are included with this
     program.  The installation of SLiRP is done from your  shell
     account,  not  DOS. Basically, you will need  to  unzip  the
     archive first by typing:

     gunzip slirp-0.9k.tar.gz

C.   You then must "untar" the archive by typing:

     tar -xvf slirp-0.9k.tar

D.   This  will  create a directory structure called slirp-0.9k/.
     Go  to  the  src subdirectory by typing "cd slirp-0.9k/src".
     Configure SLiRP for your server by typing:

     configure

E.   Then make the executable program by typing:

     make

     This  will create a file called "slirp". Copy this  file  to
     your home directory. Type something like:

     cp slirp ~

F.   Next,  follow all the steps for using SLIP above. As far  as
     connecting  to  your SLIP provider, connect  to  your  shell
     account as you normally would. If you are connecting through
     a  terminal server, be sure to get an 8 bit connection using
     rlogin.  Some terminal servers have commands like  "terminal
     download"  or  "set session 1 passall" to provide  a  better
     connection  for pseudo SLIP users. If you have trouble  with
     Kali working through a terminal server, be sure to look into
     this. After attaching and logging in, just type slirp.  Exit
     your  communication program without hanging up and  continue
     like other SLIP users (see above).

G.   You  will  probably not be able to run Kali in  server  mode
     using a SLiRP connection.



Ethernet Setup Procedure - Normal Packet Drivers
================================================

Note:  This  section  deals with setting  up  a  straight  packet
driver. Although this works in most cases, there are some  setups
that require an ODI driver because a straight packet driver isn't
available. For these people check the next section.

A.   START  WITH  A  CLEAN BOOT!!!!! Set up your  CONFIG.SYS  and
     AUTOEXEC.BAT files to load as few drivers as possible.  Some
     definite  things  to  exclude are  memory  managers  (HIMEM,
     EMM386,  QEMM, etc.) and network drivers (e.g. LSL, IPXODI).
     Most  games  don't  need the former,  and  the  latter  will
     probably conflict with the packet driver. We recommend  that
     you   prepare  an  alternate  configuration  (the   multiple
     configuration facility built into MS-DOS is ideal  for  this
     purpose;  see your DOS manual for details) specifically  for
     Internet games with a CONFIG.SYS portion containing  only  a
     FILES=20  line, and an AUTOEXEC.BAT portion containing  only
     the  line  "prompt=$p$g". Be sure to include the line  which
     loads  your  mouse  driver (if you play your  game  using  a
     mouse).

B.   Set  up  the  packet driver. If you do not  already  have  a
     suitable packet driver installed on your machine, now is the
     time  to  install  one. Start by determining  your  Ethernet
     card's  IRQ  setting,  its base I/O port  setting,  and  its
     memory  address  setting (if any). You  should  be  able  to
     determine  this by looking at the card itself and consulting
     the  user  manual.  You'll need some  if  not  all  of  this
     information,  depending upon which  packet  driver  you  use
     and/or  type  of  hardware you have (for example,  some  IBM
     computers  with  the  MicroChannel  bus  can  determine  the
     settings  on  the card automatically without you  having  to
     supply  them on the packet driver command line).  Unzip  the
     appropriate  driver  from  Crynwr Packet  Driver  collection
     archive.  In  our  example,  the  packet  driver  is  called
     SMC_WD.COM.  By  looking  at the jumpers  on  the  card  and
     consulting the manual, I determined that the card  has  been
     set  to  IRQ  7, Base I/O port address 300h,  and  the  base
     memory address is at segment d800h. For this example, I have
     chosen  to  use interrupt 60h for the packet driver.  Packet
     drivers  typically operate on an interrupt in the  range  of
     60h to 80h inclusive; since nothing else in my sample system
     happens to be using the first available interrupt (INT 60h),
     I  chose  that. Thus, to load my packet driver,  I  use  the
     command line

     SMC_WD 0x60 0x7 0x300 0xd800

     where  0x60 is the packet driver interrupt, 0x7 is  the  IRQ
     setting on the card, 0x300 is the I/O port base address, and
     0xd800 is the memory base address (NOTE: all numbers are  in
     C-style  HEX notation). Don't worry if you don't  understand
     what  all this stuff means - as long as you use the  correct
     numbers, your packet driver should work. NOTE: If your PC is
     currently  part  of a Novell network (e.g. Netware,  Netware
     Lite, Personal Netware) the parameters you need can be found
     in  a  file called NET.CFG, usually located in your \NOVELL,
     \NWLITE  or  \NWCLIENT subdirectories (along  with  all  the
     other drivers needed by Novell). Add the proper command line
     to  the AUTOEXEC.BAT for your Kali configuration so that the
     packet driver will be loaded automatically whenever you boot
     using the Kali partition.

     When  successfully loaded, the packet driver should  give  a
     sign on message and report the Ethernet address of your  NIC
     when  you  load it. Chances are that if your  NIC  has  been
     functioning properly for other tasks (e.g. as a  node  on  a
     Novell  network) then you'll have no problems here. If  not,
     or  if there are any error or warning messages, something is
     wrong  (D'OHH!). One possibility is that one of the settings
     on  your  NIC is in conflict with those of another expansion
     card in your system. No two cards can have the same IRQ, I/O
     port,  or memory address settings, nor can the memory  areas
     of  two  cards overlap. Whatever the cause, you'll  need  to
     find and correct the problem before continuing.



Ethernet Setup Procedure - ODI driver
=====================================

A.   Unzip  the  ODI packet driver by typing "PKUNZIP ODIPKT"  in
     the  Kali  directory.  You should get  LSL.COM,  ODIPKT.EXE,
     STARTNET.BAT,  NET.CFG, TERMIN.COM, and  ODIPKT.DOC  (a  doc
     similar to this section).

B.   Find  an  ODI  driver for your Ethernet card. This  will  be
     found on the setup disk that came with the Ethernet card. If
     you  can't  find it, then there's no need to  read  anything
     else... :)

C.   Put  your  ODI  driver in Kali directory with all  of  these
     other files.

D.   Edit net.cfg for the correct settings. These settings may be
     different  depending on your particular Ethernet card.  Read
     the  ODI instructions and sample net.cfg file that came with
     your Ethernet card for more information.

     Sample net.cfg for a 3c509 driver:

     Link Support
          Buffers   4 1500
          MemPool   4096

     link driver 3C509
          Int       5
          Port      300
          Mem       c8000
          Frame     Ethernet_II

     Note:  replace "3C509" with the name of your own ODI  driver
     (do not add the .exe suffix).

E.   Edit startnet.bat to run your own ODI driver. For example:

     @echo off
     lsl
     3c509
     odipkt 0 96

F.   Run  STARTNET.BAT by typing STARTNET at the DOS prompt.  You
     should get messages like this:

     ODIPKT is installed and ready.

G.   Run Kali like normal.

H.   Unload  ODIPKT by typing "TERMIN 0x60". Make  sure  Kali  is
     unloaded before doing this since TERMIN doesn't check.



          Chapter III: Making the Internet Connection

A:   Configuring your Internet connection

     Your  Internet settings for Kali and all other wattcp  based
     programs   are   stored   in  wattcp.cfg.   Other   Internet
     applications  like  CUTCP use their own configuration  files
     (for CUTCP the settings are stored in config.tel).


     PPP users

     The  load.bat file should have already configured wattcp.cfg
     for  you except for the nameserver. Ethernet and SLIP  users
     would  have to edit this manually. If you have a problem  or
     you want to setup your nameserver you can edit wattcp.cfg by
     using  an  editor to edit/view its contents. Your wattcp.cfg
     file would look something like this (do not actually use any
     of the numbers listed below; this is just an example):

          ppp = 1
          nameserver = 123.123.123.10
          my_ip = 123.123.123.22
          netmask = 255.255.255.0
          gateway = 123.123.123.1

     The  ppp  = 1 setting tells Kali that we are using PPP.  The
     nameserver tells Kali and other wattcp apps where to  lookup
     Internet  names.  For example, if you  wanted  to  access  a
     server  called "kali.net" you will have to list a nameserver
     so wattcp can lookup that name and try to connect to it's IP
     number: 205.244.188.24.

     The  number  for netmask and gateway will usually  stay  the
     same  after  each  connection. For  most  people  the  my_ip
     setting will change each time you connect. The load.bat file
     runs a program called PPPWAT which will automatically update
     this  number  for you so you won't have to  change  it  each
     time.


     Ethernet users

     Contact the network administrator for your site and find out
     the  IP  address for your machine, the IP address  for  your
     gateway  or  router, the IP address of at least  one  Domain
     Name  Server local to your site, and your netmask value.  IP
     addresses  consist  of four groups of  digits  separated  by
     periods.  In  our  example,  the  machine's  IP  address  is
     128.191.23.5,  the gateway is 128.191.23.1, the  netmask  is
     255.255.255.0, and the nameserver address is 128.191.44.67.

     NOTE:  it is important to use the numeric IP addresses,  not
     the  actual  host  names. NOTE: If you have  other  Internet
     programs  currently  installed on your machine,  such  as  a
     Gopher client, the Trumpet newsreader, or the iFrag program,
     you  can  probably  find the information  you  need  in  the
     configuration  files  used  for  those  programs.   If   the
     application  is based on the Waterloo TCP package,  it  will
     have  its own WATTCP.CFG, in which case you can simply  copy
     it  over to your Kali directory. When you have collected all
     this  information, use your favorite ASCII  text  editor  to
     edit the WATTCP.CFG file in your Kali directory. Edit or add
     the  lines beginning with my_ip=, gateway=, nameserver=, and
     netmask=. On our example machine, the WATTCP.CFG file for an
     Ethernet user looks like this:

          my_ip = 128.191.23.5
          gateway = 128.191.23.1
          netmask = 255.255.255.0
          nameserver = 128.191.23.9

     Save the changed file and exit back to DOS.

     If you don't know the proper values for some or all of these
     settings,  you can see if your site runs what  is  called  a
     BOOTP server. If your LAN has a BOOTP server installed,  you
     can  put  "BOOTP" on the "my_ip=" line and leave  the  other
     lines  out  (except the ppp=1 line). Kali will  contact  the
     BOOTP  server  and determine all the settings  it  needs  to
     communicate  with  other machines on the Internet.  If  your
     site  is  not running a BOOTP server, then your  task  is  a
     little more difficult (but not impossible!).

     If  you  know  your  machine's IP  address,  but  you  can't
     determine the other values, you can often get away with some
     educated  guesswork. For instance, the gateway for a  subnet
     usually has an IP address ending in .1, as is the case  with
     our  example.  Thus, if your IP address is  xxx.yyy.zzz.www,
     try  setting your gateway's IP address to xxx.yyy.zzz.1.  As
     for  the  subnet mask, a common value for this parameter  is
     255.255.255.0.  In  some cases, the  gateway  value  can  be
     something  like  xxx.yyy.1.1 with  a  corresponding  netmask
     value of 255.255.0.0 - if one doesn't work, it can't hurt to
     try  the other. Finally, if you don't know your nameserver's
     IP  address,  you  can probably get by without  it  for  the
     purposes   of  playing  Internet  games.  Since  you'll   be
     specifying IP addresses for all of your opponents' machines,
     a  nameserver  lookup won't be necessary  to  resolve  their
     addresses.


     SLIP users

     You will only have to know the IP# and a nameserver; the IP#
     is  usually  reported each time you connect. The  nameserver
     isn't required for Kali. IP addresses consist of four groups
     of   digits  separated  by  periods.  In  our  example,  the
     machine's  IP  address is 128.191.23.5  and  the  nameserver
     address is 128.191.44.67.

     When  you have collected this information, use your favorite
     ASCII  text editor to edit the WATTCP.CFG file in your  Kali
     directory.  Edit or add the lines beginning with  my_ip  and
     nameserver=.  On  our example machine, the  WATTCP.CFG  file
     looks like this:

         ppp = 1
         my_ip = 128.191.23.5
         nameserver = 128.191.23.9

     NOTE:  The requirement for PPP=1 for SLIP users is new.   We
     know it's not a PPP connection, but with the addition of the
     "ether"  option needed for slipper/cslipper the SLIP  driver
     now works like the PPP driver by emulating an Ethernet card.

     Save the changed file and exit back to DOS.

     If you don't know the proper values for some or all of these
     settings,  you can see if your site runs what  is  called  a
     BOOTP server. If your LAN has a BOOTP server installed,  you
     can  put  "BOOTP" on the "my_ip=" line and leave  the  other
     lines  out  (except the ppp=1 line). Kali will  contact  the
     BOOTP  server  and determine all the settings  it  needs  to
     communicate  with  other machines on the Internet.  If  your
     site  is  not running a BOOTP server, then your  task  is  a
     little more difficult (but not impossible!)

B.   Testing Your Internet Connection

     The  easiest  way  to test your connection  is  to  use  the
     PING.EXE program. This application will try to send a packet
     to another node on the Internet and if everything is working
     the  other node will respond and PING will display the  time
     for  the  packet to make the round trip. If  you  are  using
     SLiRP for SLIP/PPP emulation the ping command will not  work
     (skip this test).

     Try typing:

     PING 205.244.188.24  10

     This   will   send  10  ping  packets  to  the   server   at
     205.244.188.24.  If everything is working you should  get  a
     response  to most of these packets. Don't expect  to  get  a
     response  to  all 10 packets. You should get about  7  or  8
     responses  each time. Try this using other IP  numbers  that
     you know exist.


C.   Testing your name server

     The NSLOOKUP.EXE program will ask your nameserver to convert
     Internet  numbers  to names or names to numbers.  This  test
     will not work if you didn't fill in the nameserver entry  in
     wattcp.cfg.   This is not required for Kali to work.  Try  a
     few different queries like:

          NSLOOKUP 205.244.188.24
          NSLOOKUP ftp.cdrom.com
          NSLOOKUP kali.net

     Each  query should return the "resolved" name or number.  It
     will  automatically convert names to numbers or  numbers  to
     names.


D.   Your Internet connection works!

     You  should now have a good packet driver connection  and  a
     good  Internet  connection. Kali should now  work  properly.
     Read the next chapter on setting up and running Kali.



                Chapter IV: Making the Kali Connection

A.   Configuring Kali

     To  configure Kali you will have to edit the kali.cfg  file.
     At  this time there is no menu available to do this for you.
     Use  the  DOS edit command or your favorite text  editor  to
     edit the file kali.cfg.

     Your  kali.cfg file might look something like this (actually
     my kali.cfg file looks very much like this):

          nickname = KingThug
          realname = My Name
          email = me@my.com
          other = Call 1-800-965-KALI and order Kali today!
          location = USA, Earth, Sol
          tracker = 205.244.188.24
          @newworld = 205.244.188.24
          @bob = 128.191.23.34

     The   nickname,  realname,  email,  and  tracker  lines  are
     required. Always set tracker to the number above unless  you
     are informed that the tracker has been moved.

     The  lines  beginning with the @ sign are server  shortcuts.
     These lines allow you to type:

     KALI @newworld

     and  Kali  will look in the kali.cfg file for "@world="  and
     replace this with the actual ip# or address.

     The  "tracker"  tells  Kali where  the  global  Kali  Server
     Tracker  is  located. You can type "kali /l" and  Kali  will
     query all the servers on the Kali Tracker.

B.   Configuring Kali Chat (kchat)

     Edit  the  kchat.cfg file just like you edited the  kali.cfg
     file using a test editor. Here is a sample kchat.cfg file:

         Nickname = KingThug
         lines = 50
         beeponarrival
         macro1 = I *really* hate macros!
         macro2 = This is my second macro!
         macro3 = This is my third macro!
         macro8 = This is my eighth macro!
         macro9 = /quit Bah! Humbug!

     The  macros  are accessible by pressing alt-#,  where  #  is
     replaced by the number of the macro. "lines" can be  set  to
     25  or  50.  "beeponarrival" causes Kali Chat to  beep  when
     people join. Read the sample kchat.cfg for more information.


C.   Querying the Kali Tracker

     At the DOS prompt (while still in your Kali directory) type:

     KALI /L

     Kali should display a list of servers. You will see a server
     number, a server name, an ip#, a description, and possibly a
     list of players who are connected to each server.

D.   Connect to a server

     Decide which of the servers you want to connect to and type:

          KALI #<server number>

     Replace  <server  number> with the number from  the  Tracker
     listing  above.  Optionally you can  enter  the  servers  IP
     number manually by typing:

          KALI 205.244.188.24

     That  IP  number would connect you to the Kali server  named
     -> Descent <-.

     Once  connected you should see a detailed list  of  everyone
     connected to the server and what "process" they are running.
     The  "process" might be a game or it might say "KCHAT" which
     means the users is in the chat facility.



                        Chapter V: Using Kali

A.   Finding other players: using Kali Chat (KCHAT)

     When  you  connected you should have seen a list of  players
     connected  to  the server. Typing "kali /s" will  re-display
     this  list for you. If you see players with a process called
     "DESCENTR"  then they are running the registered version  of
     Descent.  See the file kaligame.faq for a detailed  list  of
     games that show up in Kali. If you want to play Descent with
     these  people already playing you can simply run Descent  at
     this time and join a network game in progress.

     If  you  want to play any game other than Descent  you  will
     have  to  find other players. Players waiting for  games  or
     just  wanting  to  talk usually run Kali Chat.  If  you  see
     people  listed with a process called "KCHAT" then  you  know
     these people are chatting. Just type:

          KCHAT

     at the DOS prompt and you should enter the Chat screen.

     Kali  Chat is an IRC-like chat program for IPX networks.  It
     was written to help people using Kali communicate before and
     after playing games. You will automatically start out on the
     #chat  channel.  To  see who else is on this  channel,  type
     /who. To see everyone using Kali Chat, type /who *. To see a
     list if users on a specific channel, type /who #channelname.
     To  join  a channel, type /join #channelname. To exit,  type
     /quit. After finding players for a game, exit Kali Chat  and
     directly  launch  your game as you would for  a  normal  IPX
     network  game (see the Chapter X or read your game's network
     gaming instructions).
B.   More stuff on Kali Chat:

     The following commands can be issued while in Kali Chat. The
     "/" prefix is used for all commands:

     /help - display the list of commands
     /clear - clear screen
     /[25|50] - select 25 or 50 line mode
     /away <message> - tell everyone you are away from your PC
     /beep [on|off] - beep when getting a private message
     /messages [on|off] - turns on or off server messages
     /formet [on|off] - turns off or on text formatting
     /join <#channel> - join a different channel
     /who [<#channel>|*] - list people using Kali Chat
     /whois <nickname> - get information on a registered user
     /process <game> - show servers that have <game> listed
     /msg [<nickname>|#<node>] <message> - send a private message
     /me <message> - posture a message
     /ping [<nickname>|#<node>|*] - test connection speed
     /ignore <nickname> - toggles the ability to ignore someone
     /offer <filename> - offer a file for people to download
     /deoffer [file#|all] - cancel offer(s)
     /get <nickname> <#> <name> - get file <#> as <name>
     /xget <nickname> <#> <name> - like /get but overwrites
     /progress - displays download progress (from sender)
     /kali - list people connected to the Kali server
     /names - list names and email address of user on server
     /servers - list all active servers
     /servers! - list all active servers and players
     /channels - list all active channels on this server
     /users - list users (includes channel and IP#)
     /info <nickname> - display information on a chat user
     /motd - display message of the day from server
     /shell [<message>] - shell to DOS prompt (lose messages)
     /quit [<message>] - exit chat program

     PgUp  and  PgDn can be used to scroll back to  see  previous
     text.   Ctrl-PgUp and Ctrl-PgDn will go to the top or bottom
     of  the message buffer.  Use the up arrow key to scroll back
     through   previously  typed  messages.   Use  Tab  to   make
     responding  to private messages easier (it will recall  last
     nickname uses).

     Pressing  alt-x  will also exit Kali Chat.  Pressing  ctrl-l
     will clear the screen.

     When  offering a file you can offer up to 10 files at a time
     and  several  people can download these files  at  the  same
     time.  When you "get" a file, you can name the file anything
     you  want and put it in any directory you want. For example,
     if   Wyvern  offers  the  file  "#0  c:\kali\kchat.exe"  for
     downloading,    you    can    type    "/get     Wyvern     0
     d:\games\kali\kchat20.exe". This will take file  number  "0"
     offered   by   Wyvern  and  place  it   in   the   directory
     d:\games\kali\ and name the file kchat20.exe.



             Chapter VI: Using Kali Without a Kali Server

     Kali will work without a server by having one of the PCs act
     as  a  server.  In this mode Kali will only allow  8  player
     games  (the  server plus seven clients). The  server  has  a
     special role in this mode and the faster PC should take  the
     honors. This PC will simply type:

          KALI

     and  press enter. The other PCs will use the IP# of the host
     just like they would when connecting to a normal server. The
     kali /s listing will not include the ping, process, loss, or
     time  columns  like  it  does when using  a  normal  server.
     Everything else should work normally.



                     Chapter VII: Purchasing Kali

         Chapter VIII: Kali Servers, ftp Sites, and Web Sites

A.   This is the latest list of Kali servers:

     Servers can be found by typing "kali /l".

B.   Kali and related files can be found at these ftp sites:

     ftp://ftp.kali.net/pub/kali/

C.   The  following Web site also include information and some
     files:

     http://www.kali.net/


                     Chapter IX: Troubleshooting

Hopefully  this  might help some people who  are  having  trouble
getting Kali to work. Just read the questions.


Q:   PPPMENU just can't seem to open LCP. What can I try?

A:   Try  removing  the  lines "ACCOMP ON" and  "PCOMP  ON"  from
     net.cfg.  Before pressing alt-s make sure you get a  message
     indicating  that  a PPP session has started  or  you  get  a
     series  of strange characters. Some systems require  special
     prefixes  and  suffixes on usernames.  See  the  Chapter  II
     section C-4 for more information.

Q:   PPPMENU reports that LCP is open but ICMP is not.  Why?

A:   Normally IPCP won't open because of a communication problem
     between your PC and the server.  The modem's init string
     probably needs to be fixed.  For a USR or Gateway2000 Teleport
     modem use the "at&f1" init string.  For all 100% Hayes
     compatables use "at&f2".  Not all modems are 100% Hayes
     compatable so check the "at" commands to see which one on
     your modem will setup the default configuration to enable
     RTS/CTS flow control, disable XON/XOFF flow control, enable
     data compression, and enable error correction.  If it's still
     not working send a copy of your net.cfg file along with a
     description of your modem.  Also let us know what you see on
     the screen when you manually log in.

     Also, with Klos 1.45 there is a bug that will cause IPCP to
     get disabled after editing some of the settings in pppmenu.
     Either go back to pppmenu and re-enable IPCP or go to the
     net.cfg file and remove the line that says IPCP DISABLE.


Q:   Why does PING report, "ERROR: Cannot access packet driver"?

A:   Either  the  packet  driver didn't load  properly  from  the
     load.bat  file or you are running Kali already.  You  cannot
     run PING while Kali is loaded.


Q:   Why   does   Kali   report,   "Error:   no   response   from
     xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"?

A:   Either because the server you are trying to attach to is not
     running Kali or you don't have Kali configured properly.

     Have you tested your connection yet? Can you ping any or all
     of  the  servers?  Have you tested your Internet  connection
     yet?


Q:   Why can't I ping anything?

A:   Good  question! This means you are actually trying  to  test
     your connection before using Kali! I'm very happy!

     Anyway,  this is almost always caused by an incorrect  value
     in  wattcp.cfg. Either your netmask, gateway, or my_ip value
     is most likely wrong (assuming the PPP connection was tested
     successfully)

     Are  you  absolutely positive that your modem is  configured
     for   hardware  flow  control  (RTS/CTS)  and  not  software
     (XON/XOFF)?  For Hayes compatible modems, this  is  normally
     done with AT&F2. For USR modems, try using AT&F1.

     Try  using  a  netmask  of 0.0.0.0 in  wattcp.cfg.  Using  a
     netmask  of  0.0.0.0 will make the wattcp kernel think  that
     all  nodes are in your local network. It will cause Kali and
     other wattcp apps to quit trying to use the gateway.


Q:   I can ping a server, but I can't connect with Kali. Why?

A:   Wow...getting close. The most common problem causing this is
     an incorrect modem init string. Make sure that hardware flow
     control  and  NOT  software flow control is  enable  on  the
     modem.  This  can  also  be  caused  by  having  the   wrong
     information in wattcp.cfg. The server might be off-line. Try
     another  server. This also might be caused by a firewall  on
     your  network connection. Ask your Internet provider if they
     support UDP packets.


Q:   OK,  I  finally connected to a server. Now my  PC  locks  up
     after  a  few  seconds. I haven't even started a  game  yet.
     Sometimes  it locks up before I even run Kali.  Sometimes  I
     get the player list. What did I do wrong?

A:   The  following  information  is  everything  we  know  about
     problems  with the DOS version of Kali locking  up.  If  the
     following  information doesn't help, please don't ask  "what
     else can I try?" We can't think of anything else. Seriously.
     If  you think of something that we might have missed or your
     setup  might  include some information we never  thought  of
     please  feel free to offer comments or suggestions  or  even
     ask questions which aren't answered.

     If  Kali  lockups  very often in almost every  program  then
     something is probably wrong with the communications  to  the
     modem. The initialization string, the modem, or the com port
     is  at  fault. What type of modem do you have?  Internal  or
     external? Do you have a 16650 uart? Use the find_com utility
     to  find out. You will need to check your modem's manual for
     the proper initialization string to enable only RTS/CTS flow
     control. XON/XOFF and DCE/DTE flow control must be disabled.
     You  also  want  to  be  sure  data  compression  and  error
     correction are enabled. 90% of all lockup problems  are  the
     result of the wrong initialization string, a bad uart, or  a
     cheap modem.

     Run  the performance test in pppmenu and check the send  and
     receive  speeds. If they don't stay the same (like the  send
     is  fast and receive is slow or none) then your modem  isn't
     setup  for RTS/CTS flow control. If the numbers jump up  and
     down a lot you need to lower the modem speed set in net.cfg.

     With  a 16650 uart and a 28.8 modem you should expect speeds
     of  about 5000-6000 cps in the performance test. You can get
     higher  speeds  if you run at 115200 and your host  supports
     this speed, but if your host doesn't support this speed your
     performance values will jump up and down a lot. With a 16450
     uart  you  must  set the speed to 38400 or less.  This  will
     result  in speeds of 3000-4000cps in pppmenu.  With an  8250
     uart  you  cannot run faster than 19200. This  will  produce
     speeds  at  about  2000cps in pppmenu. As you  can  see  the
     better uarts can make a big difference in throughput.

     A  common  init  string  for  a Hayes  compatible  modem  is
     "at&f2".  There are a lot of modems that claim to  be  Hayes
     compatible  where  this init string will  NOT  work.  Please
     check  the manual. Almost all USR modems need an init string
     of "at&f1". When editing net.cfg set the modem init as MODEM
     INIT3 "myinitstring". In pppmenu leave the default values in
     modem inits 1 and 2 and enter the proper init for your modem
     in init 3.

     If you are desperate see if you can try a different com port
     or different modem. Sometimes an incompatibility between the
     modem  you use and the one your ISP uses will cause  similar
     problems. If you are considering buying a new modem be  wary
     of cheap no-name brands. Most complaints like this come from
     people using modems I've never heard of. I almost never  get
     complaints from USR users.

     You might also have an interrupt conflict between your modem
     and  another  device in your PC. Be sure that  sound  cards,
     mice,  and  other hardware don't use the same  interrupt  as
     your  modem. Try disabling all sound drivers in  your  setup
     (config.sys  and  autoexec.bat)  and  disabling  the   sound
     drivers in the game and see if it helps. Try removing CD-ROM
     drivers, if possible.

     A  lot  of  complaints come from people using the  DOS  that
     comes  with Win95. If you are using this version of DOS  try
     getting a DOS 6.22 boot disk and see if that will help.

     Kali can work properly with the proper setup. There are many
     thousands of happy users from all over the world using  Kali
     without these problems. In a few cases I've never been  able
     to  fix  the  problem completely, but even  then  it's  been
     possible  to reduce the occurrence of lockups to  the  point
     that some games were still enjoyable.

     Kali  puts a load on your modem that is quite different from
     most  applications. When you play a game  Kali  sends  *and*
     receives  data  at full speed constantly. Most  applications
     only  receive  data  at  full speed. Usually  these  lockups
     occurs  because  the communication between the  PC  and  the
     modem  breaks  down  and the PC gets stuck  trying  to  send
     packets.


Q:   How can I get more conventional memory?

A:   Use  a memory manager such as DOS's emm386 or QEMM. Load DOS
     high and load Kali high (lh Kali). Add the "noems" option to
     the emm386 or QEMM line in config.sys. You might be able  to
     get  Kali  into an upper memory block on some systems.  Read
     your DOS manual or type "help emm386" at the DOS prompt.  If
     use  have  a CDROM, try to avoid loading all of its drivers.
     Using   DOS   6.0   and  above  you  can   create   multiple
     configurations in your config.sys. Again, read the DOCS. Try
     adding  "lh  "  in  front of lsl, ppp,  and  ipstub  in  the
     load.bat file.

     Most games that use their own memory manager (like Doom  and
     Descent) will still work when used with emm386 or QEMM. They
     also  still need at least some minimal conventional  memory.
     Both  Doom  and  Descent will have fits if the  conventional
     memory is below 350K (approx.).

Q:   Why do my games run so slow?

A:   Depends. All games will run fast if your connection is  fast
     enough and your PC is fast enough (with enough memory). Even
     a 28.8 modem and a P5-166 won't run Doom fast enough in most
     cases because of the specific game design, but a 486-33 with
     a 14.4 modem might play a good game of Descent (one-on-one).

     Tips for improving speed:

     1.   Faster  modem. Upgrading from a 14.4 to  a  28.8  modem
          makes a world of difference in almost all cases. Do not
          use  anything slower than 14.4.  A 16550 uart will also
          help  quite  a bit.  Run find_com to see what  type  of
          uart  you have (16650 is faster, 16450 is slower,  8250
          is junk).
     2.   Faster PC. Kali has some processing overhead that might
          require   more  CPU.  Running  a  Pentium   is   highly
          recommended.
     3.   More  memory. Most games will run too slow with only  4
          megs of RAM. 8 megs is recommended.
     4.   Pick a different game. Duke Nukem runs much faster than
          Doom,  and  Warcraft runs much faster  than  Command  &
          Conquer. The original Descent normally runs faster than
          Descent 2 because Descent 2 is more complicated.
     5.   When  hosting  a  game of Descent 2 select  the  "Short
          Packets" option and lower the packets-per-second  to  5
          or  6.  This might make the other ships jump  a  little
          more on the screen, but this will reduce the lag.
     6.   When  hosting  a  game  of Warcraft2  be  sure  to  use
          war2kali   (see   http://www.blizzard.com   for    more
          information).
     7.   When  playing Doom use the kalidoom patch. You can  get
          this from ftp://ftp.kali.net/pub/kali/kalidoom.zip

Q:   Why  don't  I get the list of games or servers or  sometimes
     get an incomplete list?

A:   You  are losing packets. The Internet isn't very dependable.
     Messages are dropped all the time. Kali does not keep trying
     to  get  the list until it succeeds. You just need  to  keep
     trying to retrieve the list.

Q:   Kali95 reports a duplicate or invalid serial number. Why?

A:   You  may  have  entered  the serial  number  or  skey  value
     incorrectly.  Please check both numbers  carefully.  We  get
     about 10 messages every day from users who claim the numbers
     we  sent  will not work. They insist that they have  checked
     and  re-checked these numbers, and when they  show  us  what
     they  entered  it  always turns out to be  a  typo.  Always.
     Please  check  carefully. Both numbers are  12  digits.  The
     letter O (capital o) is not used. If it looks like this,  0,
     then  it's a zero. The letter l (lower case L) is not  used.
     If it looks like this, 1, then it's a one.

     If  the  problem goes away after a couple of  minutes  don't
     worry. This is normal. The server is confused.

Q:   People  in  Descent  appear to be doing  impossible  things!
     Going  through walls. Jumping around. I can't even  seem  to
     hit them and yet they hit me all the time! What causes this?

A:   Either  lag,  packet loss, or cheating. Actual  cheating  is
     quite  rare, but possible. If this happens all the  time  to
     lots of different people then I suspect that you either have
     a  packet loss or lag problem. If you fly around in circles,
     do people tend to shoot in the right direction to hit you or
     do they tend to aim behind you? If behind, then your packets
     are  taking too long to go from user to user and  both  your
     and  the  other player's shots are missing the target.  When
     you  fire  at  someone, if you never hear  the  damage  then
     you're  suffering from packet loss. A slow  connection  will
     cause either of these effects.

Q:   When  I  type  "load"  the PC hangs or doesn't  display  the
     connect option. What did I do wrong?

A:   Run  the  find_com  program that  came  with  Kalidos.  This
     program should list your com ports. Do you see the com  port
     your  modem is on? If not, or it reports an error, then your
     modem  is  probably  not configured to  work  from  DOS.  By
     default  a  lot of modems are only installed  to  work  from
     Windows.  In  Windows it might claim to be  on  com1,  com2,
     com3,  or  com4,  but  this  is only  while  running  inside
     Windows. From DOS it might not be visible at all.  Check the
     modem's manual to see if there are any jumpers that must  be
     set to allow your modem to work from DOS. Be sure to put  it
     on  a com port that is not currently in use (use find_com to
     see which ports are in use).

Q:   I  entered my registration codes and Kali still stops  after
     15 minutes. What's wrong?

A:   Are  you  sure you entered those numbers correctly?  Do  you
     still  see  the  registration message  when  unloading  Kali
     (kali/u)? You might check with your Internet provider to see
     if they have a time-out that needs set differently.


Q:   I  entered the codes, but I still see a shareware screen. Do
     I need to buy something else or get a different program?

A:   You are probably seeing the Klos shareware message. The Klos
     driver  is  separate from Kali. You do not need to  register
     that  driver  for  use with Kali. If you want  to,  you  can
     contact Klos, sales@klos.com, to buy the commercial version.
     The  commercial  version will not run  Kali  any  faster  or
     easier.  To get past that annoying screen either  press  Esc
     while it's displayed or setup the PPP driver to use a script
     (and then you can remove the pppmenu line from load.bat).


Q:   Do I need kmech for the DOS version of NetMech?

A:   No. That's only needed for the Win95 version of NetMech.


Q:   Will Kali work with AOL, Prodigy, Pipeline, GNN, or WOW?

A:   Maybe.  Each of those companies is working on getting  32bit
     Winsock drivers for Kali95.  Check to see if a 32bit  driver
     is available yet.

Q:   This stupid document didn't help. What do I do now?

A:   If  this list doesn't answer your question, please send your
     question to the following address:

     support@kali.net

     ***NOTE*** You must include the following information for us
     to  be  able  to  help. Without this information,  we  won't
     answer most questions.

     1.   What version of Kali are you using?
     2.   What version of DOS are you using?
     3.   What brand/model of modem and speed?
     4.   A copy of kali.cfg
     5.   A copy of wattcp.cfg
     6.   A copy of net.cfg
     7.   A  description of the problem and what steps  you  have
          taken to try to resolve the problem. We want to know at
          what  point in the instructions in kali.doc  you  can't
          get  past. If you send us email stating that you cannot
          connect to any servers  and don't tell us that you  can
          ping  it successfully, we will just send you a copy  of

          first.


                Chapter X: Playing Games on Kali

When using Kali and connected to a server, your PC thinks that it
is  connected  to  a large global IPX network.  Games  that  were
written  to be played over local networks using the IPX  protocol
will  now work over the Internet through Kali. You can start your
game  just like a normal multiplayer game would start on a  local
IPX network. We suggest reading the game's manual for details and
options that might be available.  If the game that you are  dying
to  play isn't listed below, sorry man.  There are SO many games,
revisions, patches, and expansion sets that come out every *week*
that  it  is hard to stay on top of it all!  Really, we  do  try,
`cause  a  lot  of  this new stuff is cool.  But  we  do  have  a
suggestion.  We often learn about other games from Kali users who
post  mail on the Kali mailing list.  And you can too!  Just send
email  to "Majordomo@kali.net" with the following command in  the
body  of  your message:  subscribe kali <your name>  <your  email
address>

Now for the games.  Let's do this alphabetically, shall we?

ATF:

Ah,  a perk of using Kali for DOS is that you can play this game.
You can't play this one in Kali95.  Now you need the ATF software
and the ATF patch.  Get the patch, atf_114.exe, at EA's FTP or at
ATF  Psycho Central at http://www.ao.net/~chuck/atf/atfsycho.htm.
You  then  have to optimize the available memory in DOS to  allow
ATF  to  run  with  Kali loaded.  You need to  free  up  490k  of
conventional  memory.  You also need a fast  Internet  connection
(28.8  or  better).   If you are having some lag  problems  while
playing ATF, turn the graphics detail down.

Before  starting up ATF, find out how many people  are  going  to
play  in your game and who has the fastest computer.  The fastest
computer will be the Host.  Also decide what Group ID everyone is
going  to  use  (any number between 0 and 9).   Go  to  your  ATF
directory  and type ATF.  Click on "Multi-player" on  the  silver
Menu  bar at the top of the screen.  In the drop-down menu, click
on "Network.".  Type in your callsign (nickname).  Set the number
of  players  and  the Group ID.  Now, the host clicks  on  "Call"
button  and everyone else clicks on "Answer" button.  If you  get
connected  all right, you will see "Successful Connection".   One
more  thing - don't use the Network Address book for Kali gaming.
It's only for true IPX play.


Big Red Racing:

First try to find a few people who might like to play.  You  need
to know ahead of time how many players there will be.  Quit Kchat
and type "racing" from your Big Red Racing directory.  Enter your
name   (or   nickname),  if  the  game  asks  for   it.    Choose
"Multiplayer".  Next screen:  Click on the smiley faces until you
have the right number of players (including yourself!).  You  can
have  up to 6 smiley, `er players!  Now click on "Network  Play".
Set  all  your character choices and control options.   Wait  for
other  players.  You need to see a car for each player  that  you
are  expecting to play with, before you continue.  If you  see  a
lot  of  unrecognizable names here, then your  game  is  probably
getting mixed up with someone else's game.  If you can't seem  to
get  a game with your buddies going, move to another server where
no  one else is playing Big Red.    Next in the setup, You get  a
chance  to  pick the type of race you want and then,  at  another
screen, you pick the type of vehicle you want.  Soon you'll be at
the Starting Line!

If  you  have  problems with the game suddenly crashing  on  you,
there may be a disparity of speeds between your computer and  the
other player(s) computer(s).  I think the error message you might
get  is  something like "Net Version Mismatch".  If, for example,
I'm  playing BRR on a 486DX and you are playing against me  on  a
Pentium 120, then BRR might crash because of the speed difference
between  our  computers.  The disparity  in  the  speeds  of  our
Internet  connections can cause this problem too.  BUT there  are
some  parameters  in BRR that you can play with  that  might  fix
this.   These  parameters are stored in the config file  that  is
created and loaded when you type in your name or nick at the very
beginning of the setup of BRR.  Type:

EDIT CAROLE(or whatever YOUR name is).cfg

Look  through  this file for the word "netspeed"  followed  by  3
numbers.   If you have the fast computer, increase the  first  of
these  3  numbers.  If you have the slow computer, decrease  this
number.   The  second  of these 3 numbers  can  be  increased  by
everyone.   The third of these 3 numbers can be changed  to  help
the   computer  that  is  the  slowest.   Increase  this  number.
However, if your race car (boat, etc.) jerks or jumps around  too
much, reduce this number.  You can read more about these netspeed
parameters in the BRR readme file.


Command & Conquer:

First try to find a few people who might want to play.  Now, quit
Kchat  and  run C&C. Select Multiplayer Game, Network,  and  then
either join or start a new game. C&C users will find it easier to
start  a  game if no other C&C games are in progress or  forming.
Find a server where no other C&C games are running.
Cyberstorm:

As  far  as  we  know, Cyberstorm can only be  played  in  Win95.
Sorry.


Descent 1:

When you are playing a game like Descent which can be entered  at
any  time,  just connect to a server, launch Descent, and  select
the  Multiplayer  option.  When  starting  Descent  1,  type   "-
DynamicSockets" beside the file name as a command-line  argument.
This  allows  you  to choose from more games because  it  assigns
multiple  socket numbers to the games.  Choose which  socket  you
will  play  on by going to "Join Multi".  PageUp and PageDown  to
scroll  through  the sockets.  Now go back and start  or  join  a
game.  Note  that since we are on the Internet you might  have  a
little trouble joining games since just one packet being lost  or
out  of  order will cause the join to fail.    Just try again  or
try a different game.  If you get into a game and you notice that
you  are  constantly  missing your targets,  then  you  might  be
experiencing game lag or packet loss.  This is especially true if
you  never hear the impact of your exploding shots.  This  is  an
indication  of a slow connection.  It might improve as  the  game
goes on or you might need to quit and join a different game.


Descent 2:

When you are playing a game like Descent which can be entered  at
any  time,  just connect to a server, launch Descent, and  select
the   Multiplayer  option.  When  starting  Descent   2,   select
"Multiplayer", then select "Start an IPX multiplayer game",  then
select  1 of the 3 missions.  At the next screen, click on  "More
options".  Change the "Packets per second" to 5 or 6 and click on
"Short  packets".  NOW you are set to play.  These options should
improve the speed of your game. Now go back and start or  join  a
game.  Note  that since we are on the Internet you might  have  a
little trouble joining games since just one packet being lost  or
out  of  order will cause the join to fail.    Just try again  or
try a different game.  If you get into a game and you notice that
you  are  constantly  missing your targets,  then  you  might  be
experiencing game lag or packet loss.  This is especially true if
you  never hear the impact of your exploding shots.  This  is  an
indication  of a slow connection.  It might improve as  the  game
goes on or you might need to quit and join a different game.

Doom:

Be  sure  everyone has the exact same version of  the  EXE  file.
Get kalidoom from:

     ftp://ftp.kali.net/pub/kali/kalidoom.zip.

For two players, type "ipxsetup -deathmatch -nomonsters -ticdup 2
-extratics 2".  For three players, add "-nodes 3" to the  command
line.


DukeNukem3D:

Getting Kali to work with DukeNukem can be frustrating sometimes,
to  say  the  least.  It can work, but because  of  a  number  of
variables it's just hard to get everything working at once.

1.   You  *must* have a ping to the other player of under  600ms.
     Type   "/ping  nickname"  in  chat  to  see  your  ping   to
     "nickname". Lower pings will help quite a lot.

2.   You  must both use the same version of Duke Nukem.  Use  the
     1.3d version.

3.   This version of Kali is setup to run Duke3D version 1.3D  or
     later  without  changes.  However if you  play  again  other
     users  with different versions you might check to make  sure
     theyhave  everything  setup properly. An  older  version  of
     Kali95,  version 0.9e, had an advanced setting called  "Duke
     Special Processing". In most cases you want this off. If you
     have  any  trouble  try turning it on, but  make  sure  both
     players  do  this. Please report which one works better  for
     you.  In  older copies of DOS Kali you would add a  line  to
     kali.cfg  that reads "nodukecode" to disable this  code.  We
     mention this

4.   To  actually start the game be sure to close Kchat first. At
     the  DOS  prompt go to your Duke directory and  type  "setup
     /f4".

5.   Be  sure to disable the Music driver. You can still run  the
     digital  sound effects, but the Music hurts the  performance
     and distracts you while playing. :)

6.   Select the Network Game option. Select the option to set the
     number  of players.  Select the option to specify  a  socket
     number. Be sure all players use the same socket number.

7.   Select  the  option to start the game. The first  thing  you
     will  see  is  a  bunch of dots until  it  finds  the  other
     player(s).  Do not press any keys at this point  or  at  any
     other  point  (unless the game tells you  otherwise)  in  an
     attempt to speed up the loading process.

8.   If  the Duke Nukem Main Menu comes up, select the option  to
     start  a  game.  One  player will get  to  select  the  game
     settings  (the player with the lowest IP#). Once  you  press
     the  key to start the game do NOT press any other keys until
     the game begins (Even if you feel like you have been staring
     at  the  "Entering Hollywood Holocaust" screen for a zillion
     years). Pressing a key will always cause it to mess up.

9.   Once  the  game starts, give it a few seconds to  make  sure
     it's really started and then run around and kill people. :)

10.  Do not modify ANY Duke Nukem files. Any modifications to the
     original files as distributed by Apogee/3D Realms will cause
     the game to fail.


Fire Fight:

As  far  as  we  know, Fire Fight can only be  played  in  Win95.
Sorry.


Heretic & Hexen:

These games can be quite slow on anything less than a T1 Internet
connection.  Just warnin' ya!  See the instructions for Doom.


Nascar:

Before you begin, make sure you have the following setup:

1.   Get the most recent version of Kali for DOS and install it.
2.   Make sure you have a full version of Nascar.
3.    Get  the Nascar patch version 1.21.  Install this  in  your
  Nascar directory.
4.   Get the Hawaii patch and install it in your Nascar
directory.  It's located at
ftp://ftp.sierra.com/pub/sierra/papyrus/

Now,  you  can  load Kali and connect to a server.   Go  to  your
Nascar directory and type:
    multi -n
If you want high resolution graphics, type:
    multi -n -h
Now,  choose Multiplayer and Direct Connect.  Set up  com  ports,
etc.  The host will need to type in a net user ID (nick) and then
select  Answer.   The other players will choose  Dial  and  leave
their net user ID blank.  This should connect you!  Now read  the
racing etiquette in the hawaii.doc file for GOOD, CLEAN FUN!

NetMech (DOS):

Activision  has a DOS version that works, as is, over  Kali.   If
you  heard  that  you  need the kmech or  kalidp  files  to  play
NetMech,  it  is not true.  These files are Kali-NetMech  patches
that work *only* for the Win95 version of Mech Warrior 2.
They will not work for the DOS version.

To  start playing NetMech, first find some people to play against
in Kchat.  Quit Kchat, then go to your NetMech directory and type
"netmech".    After  the  prologue,  choose  IPX  under   "Select
Connection  Type".  Next you will be at a screen  where  you  can
form  a game (choose "Host").  Or if you are new at this, join  a
game  that someone else is forming.  Highlight the game that  you
would  like  to  join under "Rooms" and click the "Join"  button.
Next  you will go to a screen where you can pick the "Mech"  that
you  want to use.  Then you click on the button "Dropship".   Now
your  name  should  appear in a list on  a  new  screen  entitled
"Dropship".   Click on the "Launch" button in the middle  of  the
screen to signal to the other players that you are ready to play.
The  box  to the left of your name should then turn green.   Once
everyone's box is green, the game can be started by the host.  Be
patient,  because sometimes it takes a moment  for  the  host  to
receive  the  message that everyone is clicked in  and  ready  to
play.


One Must Fall:

This  game can be quite slow on anything less than a T1  Internet
connection.  Just warnin' ya!


Quake:

The  older  DOS releases of Kali will NOT work with  Quake.   The
problem is that Quake uses an IPX packet that's over 1000  bytes.
Too  big  for  the older Kali, but something we fixed  in  Kali95
version 0.9g and DOS Kali version 1.2w.

Get ftp://kali.net/pub/kali/kali12w.exe

ALL PLAYERS MUST USE THE NEWER VERSIONS!!!!

To  use  Quake with Kali make sure someone with a fast connection
(T1  or  ISDN is preferred and recommended) act as the server  by
select  the MULTIPLAYER menu option and then selecting the option
to  START A MULTIPLAYER GAME...  That person then gets to  select
the  game settings and then select the option to BEGIN GAME.  The
other  players also select the MULTIPLAYER menu option, but  then
select  the SEARCH FOR LOCAL NETWORK GAMES option.  If a game  is
being served you can select that game and press enter to join.

So far it still looks like Quake is pretty slow over Kali. Sorry.

Terminal Velocity:

TV  (Terminal Velocity) was written by Apogee, so the  set-up  is
going  to  look  a lot like Duke Nukem's set-up.  To  launch  TV:
1.Quit  Kchat  and  go to your Duke directory.   2.Type  "setup".
3.Choose  COMM setup.  4.Change socket number to 288b or whatever
you  and your playmates agreed upon in advance.  5.Go back to the
Main  Menu.   6.Choose  Network game.   7.Change  the  number  of
players to the number of people, including yourself, who will  be
playing (duh!).  8.Launch TV.  9.Kick airborne butt!


Top Gun:

There  is a setting in the topgun.ini file that will need  to  be
adjusted.   Look  at the "Netdatarate" parameter and  adjust  the
bandwidth according to this formula:

     netdatarate  = (.7 * number_of_players * slowest_modem_rate)
               / (number_of_players - 1)

The  slowest_modem_rate is the baud of the slowest modem  of  the
players in your game.


VR Pool:

Make  sure  that  you  and  the other players  are  on  the  same
wavelength when it comes to setting all the game settings -  like
what  game (8-ball, etc.), how many matches, etc. Make  sure  you
and  the  other players have the same version of VR Pool (The  VR
Pool demo will not work over Kali).  You also need to decide  who
will  transmit  and who will receive.  Now go  to  your  VR  Pool
directory  and type: pool.  This will bring you to the Quickstart
Screen.  Type p for "Play Pool!".

The  transmitter  (sender) must select Game  &  Scoring  Options.
Then  he/she  must  select Network or Modem  Player.   Click  OK.
Choose Transmit.  The balls will rack up and you shoot first.

The  receiver  selects  Network or Modem Player  and  clicks  OK.
Choose   Receive.    Now  wait,  because   your   opponent   (the
transmitter)   gets to go first.  To talk to each  other  in  the
game,  type  Alt+c before typing your message.  As with  all  the
other  games, the faster your Internet connection is, the  better
the  game  is and the smaller your chance is of having  the  game
drop you or lockup.

WarCraft2:

Quit  Kchat  and  run  War2 by going to your War2  directory  and
typing  "war2  pkt:8". Make sure that everyone in  your  game  is
going to use this command to launch Warcraft.  Select the options
for  multiplayer IPX games and either join or host a  game.  Once
you  have  clicked on the "Join" button and are in  the  list  of
players,  click  on the box to the left of your name.   This  "X"
signals  to the host that you are ready to play!  If the game  is
excruciatingly  slow, try playing against others who  have  lower
pings  and  limit the size of your game to 3 or less  people.   A
word  about  the  file  called "war2kali.exe":   Don't  use  this
program unless everyone in your game is using it and ALL  of  you
have  very fast Internet connections (ISDN, T1, or better!).   If
you  use  it  and  you don't meet this criteria, something  AWful
might happen - like your game might play a little slower.

You ever notice how some nicks in the startup screens of War2 are
multicolored?   You can make your name colorful by  editing  your
war2.ini file in your War2 directory.  Use a text editor to  look
at this file.  At the DOS prompt, type:
    edit war2.ini
Look for the line that says:
    name= (your nick)
Put  the  cursor under the letter of your nick that you  want  to
change.   Hit  Ctrl+p and it will ask you to put  in  a  command.
Then type one of these combinations:

    ctrl+c = red
    ctrl+d = white
    ctrl+e = gray
    ctrl+f = black

If  you  enter  the correct command, then a poker  symbol  should
appear  before  the  letter.  Don't try to make  every  letter  a
different  color,  because it will not work.  You  will  have  to
space  out the colors in your name.  A long name will be able  to
handle  3 or 4 different colors.  Don't try any other ctrl+letter
combinations, because it will mess up the file.
