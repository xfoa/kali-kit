Description:
KALI CHAT is an IRC-like chat program for IPX networks.  It was written 
to help people using Kali (an IPX-TCP/IP tunneling program) communicate 
before and after playing games.  It will work over a local IPX network
or over a Kali Virtual SubNet.

To run KALI CHAT, edit kchat.cfg and then just type:

kchat 

You will automatically start out on the #chat channel.  To see who else 
is on this channel, type /who.  To see everyone using KALI CHAT, type /who *.
To see a list if users on a specific channel, type /who #channelname.

To join a channel, type /join #channelname.  To exit, type /quit.

Using KALI CHAT with Kali.  First run Kali and connect to others PCs, then 
run KALI CHAT as if you were on a local net.  After finding players for a
game, exit KALI CHAT and directly launch your game.  No need to re-run Kali.

While running KALI CHAT, type /help to get more commands.

That's it!
