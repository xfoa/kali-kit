# foax's Kali Kit

This repo contains a collection of tools and drivers to get [Kali](https://kali.net) running on an MS-DOS PC, and guides on how to set it up on real and emulated hardware.
Kali is a program that tunnels IPX network traffic over TCP/IP, allowing old games and applications that use IPX to connect over networks that only support TCP/IP, including the internet.

The programs and drivers collected here can be used directly from the `src/iso` directory, but the easiest way to get them onto a DOS machine with a CD-ROM drive is to create an ISO file using the included scripts.
This can either be used with an emulator directly, or burned onto a CD to use with real hardware.
The config files and guides included here assume a Novell NE1000 network adapter, but packet drivers are included for a large variety of NICs.

## Building the ISO

The ISO can be built using a script included in this repo, but it has only been tested on Linux.
The ISO build script requires [xorriso](https://www.gnu.org/software/xorriso/), which most should be available in most Linux distros.

To build the ISO, run:

```
./make-iso.sh
```

This will output the iso in the `build` directory.

## Building the documentation

An up-to-date version of the docs can be found [online](https://fo.ax/kali-kit/html_docs).
Optionally, you can build them from the Markdown sources included in this repo.
The docs build script requires [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and [dos2unix](https://dos2unix.sourceforge.io/), which should be available in most Linux distros.

To build the docs, run:

```
./make-docs.sh
```

This will output a stand-alone HTML version of the docs to `build/html_docs`, and a DOS-readable TXT version of the docs to `src/iso/DOCS` which will included in the ISO when it's built.

## Building everything (quick start)

```
./make-all.sh
```

All it does it run the previous two scripts. ðŸ˜‰
