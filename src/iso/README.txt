foax's Kali Kit
===============

This repo contains a collection of tools and drivers to get Kali
[https://kali.net] running on an MS-DOS PC, and guides on how to set it up on
real and emulated hardware. Kali is a program that tunnels IPX network traffic
over TCP/IP, allowing old games and applications that use IPX to connect over
networks that only support TCP/IP, including the internet.

The config files and guides included here assume a Novell NE1000 network
adapter, but packet drivers are included for a large variety of NICs. 

DOS-readable TXT documentation for this kit can be found in the DOCS directory
of this CD, as well as specific documentation for tools and drivers in the
READMEs in their directories. The latest version of this kit and the most
up-to-date HTML documentation can be found at https://fo.ax/kali-kit. Happy
networking! 
