REVISION HISTORY
----------------

Kali 1.2 (revision f)

1. Lower bandwidth requirement since PC's don't have to send and reply to
   dozens of pings per second.

2. Since the server manages the player list, the VSN will no longer get
   split.  If you see someone, everyone should see them.  The kali/s list 
   will be the same for everyone (same numbers, same order).

3. Support for nameservers.  Put nameserver = <mynameserver> in wattcp.cfg
   and you will be able to type "kali kali.net" to connect to a server.

4. Support for server list in kali.cfg.  Put @testcentral = 128.192.20.100
   in kali.cfg and then just type "kali @testcentral" to connect.

5. Smaller EXE.

6. Support for player info from server.  "Kali /w KingThug" will report
   information on the player KingThug.  Kchat support for this feature by
   typing "/whois kingthug".  Put the following in kali.cfg:

   email =
   realname =
   other =

   This stuff will showup in the whois info.

7. Reserved nicknames for registered users on server!  Be the first to
   reserve your nickname by connecting right away!  Non-registered user will
   not be able to reserve a nickname.  Noone can use your nickname if you
   are registerd.

8. kchat will auto-detect kali and use the kali nickname. There is a new
   kchat to test also.

9. kali /a will query all of the servers in the kali.cfg file which are
   setup with the @server=address system.


Kali 1.1 (revision f)

1. Serial numbers have changed.  If you are registered, you
   will get a new serial number soon.  Please don't ask for 
   this new serial number until Kali Central has been converted 
   to 1.1.

 
Kali 1.1

1. First non-beta version.  It works.  If you have trouble,
   chances are it's not Kali's fault ;-)

2. Removed the NOWELCOME option.  Kali now acts differently
   when used with a server.  If you attempt to attach to a 
   node other than the server, that node will report the
   address of the server and Kali will try to attach there
   instead.  When used without the server, it will work like 
   it used to (connect to the VSN by typing the ip# of any 
   node).  This new system is faster and more reliable than 
   the old system.

3. Added option to set the number of attempts when trying
   to find the other nodes.  Kali will report that it has 
   found the host and that it is now looking for other nodes.
   Setting "helloattempts = 1" will cause Kali to act like
   version 1.0.9h (where it doesn't wait for all nodes to
   report).  Setting "helloattempts = 10" will cause Kali to
   behave like versions prior to 1.09h.  It will wait for 10
   seconds for other nodes to report (if all report in less
   than 10 seconds it won't wait).

4. Pressing a key will no longer automatically cause Kali to
   stop searching for nodes.  You must now press alt-x to abort
   the search.

5. Kali /s now reports the average ping time to each node.

6. Kali Chat 1.8 can now use a configuration file.  Edit
   kchat.cfg to set your defaults.  New options include macros
   and the ability to change some of the default switches.

7. Kali is no longer picky about extra spaces in the kali.cfg
   file.  Is used to concider the extra spaces as part of the
   serial number or key (registered users).

8. Kali.exe, kali.cfg, wattcp.cfg, and kali.motd can all be placed
   in a directory in your path and Kali will find all the related
   files properly.

9. Compression temporarily removed.  Further tests indicate that 
   the overall compression wasn't worth the time spent compressing 
   the data.  It might go back in as an option later...maybe :)

10. Fixed a bug that would have caused problems with two people 
    playing in the same game while using the same SLiRP host.

11. Reduced the EXE file size down to 82K.

12. Added "flash".  The ability to send a signal to another user
    who might be in the middle of a game to get their attention.
    Since this could be very annoying, there is also a NOFLASH
    option for kali.cfg which causes your node to ignore these
    signals.  The flashed computer will emit a sound from the PC
    speaker upon getting the flash signal.

13. An unsuccessful bootp attempt will no longer kill the packet
    driver (causing that 0xAA error).

14. Hopefully fixed the memory error in Kali Chat (1.8).


Kali 1.0.9 (revision h)...

1. Changed function of ppp = 1 option for wattcp.cfg.  If you
   had trouble with it before, try it again now.  When using
   this option, Kali won't try the resolve ethernet addresses.

2. Added NOWELCOME option to kali.cfg.  Put the word NOWELCOME
   on a blank line in kali.cfg and Kali will stop answering
   Hello packets.  As a result, you will not be able to host
   a VSN, but your PC won't slow down when new people join the
   VSN (the welcome packet is quite large).  It is recommended
   that you do NOT use the ALERT option (kali.cfg) with this
   option.  If you do, you will here about 10 beeps each time
   someone tried to join the VSN (and your PC will slow down
   anyway).

3. etherppp users who were having trouble locking up before 
   should find this version much more stable.  Silly etherppp
   doesn't clear the direction flag before doing a string
   move when sending Kali packets.  As a result, it was writing
   backwards at times.  To help this problem, Kali now clears
   the CPU direction flag before all calls (or returns) to
   the ppp.exe driver.  It helps a lot.


Kali 1.0.9 (revision e)...

1. Arp requests for ethernet users were being delayed.  Fixed.


Kali 1.0.9 (revision d)...

1. Added a new option for wattcp.cfg.  Add "ppp = 1" if you are
   using the etherppp driver.

2. Removed usetimerirq option.

3. Various little changes that are *supposed* to help etherppp
   users.   Let me know.


Kali 1.0.9...

Fixed serious bug in 1.0.8 that prevented unregistered users from
playing each other.

Kali 1.0.8...

1. Kali /s shows which players are registered and how long they
   have been connected to your PC (not how long they have been
   running Kali overall).
2. Two new options for wattcp.cfg:
   a. sendretries = X   --the default for X is 5.  Try lowering 
			  this number and see if it plays faster.
   b. usetimerirq = 1	--if this key word exists, Kali will use
			  a slightly slower method of scanning
			  incoming packets.  Might help some PCs
			  that lockup.
3. New feature called MOTD (Message of the day).  Edit the file
   called kali.mtd.  This message is only used if you host the VSN
   (by just typing Kali).  When connecting to another host, you will
   see their MOTD.
4. MAXNODES has been removed.


Kali 1.0.7...

More bug fixes...added the ability to see what programs the other
players are running when you connect.  Removed support for a few
undocumented features...


Kali 1.0.6...

Fixes a bug in the compression routine used by 1.0.5.  This caused
some packet corruption that was rare, but did cause problems like
ships being left behind when people quit Descent. 

Adds a new option for kali.cfg called MAXNODES.  Don't use this
unless you understand it.  MAXNODES will allow a person who just
types "kali" to limit the number of people in his VSN.  Anyone
connecting to his node or to nodes that are connected to him will
have this same limit (until they quit and join a different host). 
An entry like: MAXNODES = 4 will allow only 4 people in this VSN. 
The default value for MAXNODES is 100.  You cannot use a value
higher than this in 1.06.  The purpose of this option is to limit
the number of players who can join a VSN at any given time.  Some
modem users have requested this option to prevent too many people
from joining their game.  I think it's silly myself.  Oh well.

Adds another option to kali.cfg called ALERT.  By putting the
keyword ALERT on a line in your kali.cfg file, you will hear
connections being attempted by other machines.  This might help
when trying to debug problems.


Kali 1.0.5...

New features include support for shell accounts using a pseudo SLIP
driver called SLiRP.  Note: you must use version 0.9k...just
released a few days ago.  Older versions will not redirect UDP
ports properly.  Also, this version adds packet compression.  The
average packet is now 50% smaller than in previous versions.  This
should allow more players in games like Descent when played over
modems.
