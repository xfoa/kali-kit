Kali 1.2f *REGISTERED* by DiNK!

Kali is a network driver which allows 
virtually any application software
designed for use with the IPX protocol 
to be used over a TCP/IP network.
Designed primarily for use with network 
games, Kali has been successfully
tested with Descent, Command & Conquer,
DOOM, DOOM II, Heretic, Rise of the 
Triad, VR Pool, Terminal Velocity and 
SuperKarts.  Other software  should 
also work as long as it uses IPX. 
Download Kali and start putting your 
Internet connection to good use!
