# Installing network drivers and Kali in DOS

This is a very long sentence that should overflow the 80 character limit if I structure it carefully.
This is another sentence in the same paragraph that I should be able to write into a very long sentence too, easily overflowing the 80 character limit.

Some more text because I don't have a copy of Lorem ipsum to hand, otherwise I would have used that.
As it is, I just have to write some text myself that is very long so that I can use it as test data for generating docs.
